# SofaMJEDFEM plugin for visco-hyperelastic model

## Description

This plugin implements the Multiplicative Jacobian Energy Decomposition or MJED method. This discretization method is an alternative to the classical Galerkin FEM formulation. This method for discretizing non-linear hyperelastic materials on linear tetrahedral meshes leads to faster stiffness matrix assembly for a large variety of isotropic and anisotropic materials.
