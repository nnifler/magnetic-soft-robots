# DOCS

This repository contains SOFA scenes showing how to use the different components of the plugin. 
A simulation scene in SOFA can be written in:
- xml by default 
- python2 using [SofaPython2](https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython) plugin 
- python3 using [SofaPython3](https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3) plugin 

We currently don't have any examples written in xml. Feel free to contribute.
