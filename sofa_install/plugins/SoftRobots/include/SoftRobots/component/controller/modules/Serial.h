  \brief

    The class Serial offers simple access to the serial port devices for windows and linux. It can be used for any serial device (Built-in serial port, USB to RS232 converter, arduino board or any hardware using or emulating a serial port)
    The class can be used under Windows and Linux.
    The class allows basic operations like :
    - opening and closing connection
    - reading data (characters, array of bytes or strings)
    - writing data (characters, array of bytes or strings)
    - non-blocking functions (based on timeout).
