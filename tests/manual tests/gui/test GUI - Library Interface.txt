Manual test for the user story ‘GUI - Library Interface’

Test Goal: Check if there is a special section in the GUI for library definitions where all sections for the definition of different properties (e.g. material definition, magnetic force, ...) can be easily added.
User Story: As a user, I'd like to see a clearly defined sector in the window, where I can define all the details for my simulation, so that I don't have to write them into a messy config file making assumptions about everything.

Prerequisites: 
Make sure that the project is installed according to README.md and Requirements.txt

Test
1. Start of the application:
    1. Run the file $ magnetic-soft-robots/main.py
2. Check the behaviour of the application: Check whether a widget with the name "Navigation and Setting Panel" opens in the interface at start 
3. Check the console output: Ensure that no unexpected errors or warnings occur in the integrated terminal.


Expected result
	1. After starting the mainWindow.py file, a separate window with the title ‘Soft Robotic Simulation’ appears.
	2. No unexpected errors or console output.
