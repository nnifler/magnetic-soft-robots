Manual test for the user story ‘GUI - Hello World’

Test Goal: Check whether an external window is opened when the application is started
User Story: As a user of the simulation framework, I'd like to run it in a window, so that I don't have to use non-intuitive console interfaces or code files for running my simulations.

Prerequisites: 
Make sure that project is installed according to README.md and Requirements.text

Test
1. Start of the application:
    1. Run the file $ magnetic-soft-robots/main.py
2. Check the behaviour of the application: Check whether a window with the name "Soft Robotic Simulation" opens within 2 seconds
3. Window check:
    1. Maximise and minimise the window.
    2. Moving the window.
    3. Closing the window.
4. Check the console output: Ensure that no unexpected errors or warnings occur in the integrated terminal.


Expected result
	1. After starting the mainWindow.py file, a separate window with the title ‘Soft Robotic Simulation’ appears.
	2. The window can be maximised, minimised, moved and closed.
	3. No unexpected errors or console output.
