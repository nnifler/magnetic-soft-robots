Manual test for the user story ‘GUI - Hello World’

Test Goal: Check whether an external window is opened when the application is started
User Story: As a user of the simulation framework, I’d like to run it in a window, so that I don’t have to use non intuitive console interfaces or code files for running my simulations

Prerequisites: Successful cloning of the Git repository, Python extension activated and Python interpreter selected (Python 3.9+)

Preparation
1. Open project in IDE
    1. Open the IDE of your choice
    2. Open the cloned project folder in the IDE
    3. Make sure that the correct Python interpreter is selected
    4. Installing dependencies: Make sure that the package pyside6 is installed on the executing Python version, otherwise install it.
    5. Switch to the branch to test

Test
1. Start of the application:
    1. Run the file ∼/magnetic-soft-robots/main.py
2. Check the behaviour of the application: Check whether a window with the name "Soft Robotic Simulation" opens within 2 seconds
3. Window check:
    1. Maximise and minimise the window.
    2. Moving the window.
    3. Closing the window.
4. Check the console output: Ensure that no unexpected errors or warnings occur in the integrated terminal.


Expected result
	1. After starting the mainWindow.py file, a separate window with the title ‘Soft Robotic Simulation’ appears.
	2. The window can be maximised, minimised, moved and closed.
	3. No unexpected errors or console output.
