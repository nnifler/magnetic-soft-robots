Manual test for the user story ‘GUI - Select strength of magnetic field’

Test Goal: Check adjustable mechanism for modifying the magnetic field, including a slider for strength adjustment next to the force size and a widget with a field for precise vector input for the magnetic direction. These widgets should be in the previously defined library widget.
User Story: As a student of material sciences, I’d like to experiment with different magnetic fields, so that I can see how the behaviour of my models changes and develop an intuition.

Prerequisites: Successful cloning of the Git repository, Python extension activated, Python interpreter selected (Python 3.9+), dependencies installed (pyside6)

Preparation:
1. Open project in IDE
    1. Open the IDE of your choice
    2. Open the cloned project folder in the IDE
    3. Make sure that the correct Python interpreter is selected
    4. Installing dependencies: Make sure that the package pyside6 is installed on the executing Python version, otherwise install it.
    5. Switch to the branch to test

Test:
1. Start of the application:
    1. Run the file ∼/magnetic-soft-robots/main.py
2. Check the behaviour of the application: Check whether a sub widget with the name "Magnetic Field Settings" opens in the interface at start.
3. Window check:
    1. Slider for Strength Adjustment
        a. Available slider with the label Magnetic Field Strength
        b. Adjustable slider to various positions within its range
        c. Minimum, Middle and Maximum values are correct
        d. Changes in the slider position output the corresponding correct values
    2. Vector Input Field
        a. Available input field with the label Direction (Vector)
        b. Allowed: Numbers in the format [x, y, z], with optional spaces and decimal places.
        c. Invalid input is restricted: Anything that does not adhere to the format [x, y, z] with exactly three valid numbers and separators.
        d. The text field contains a description of the correct entry
4. Check the console output: Ensure that no unexpected errors or warnings occur in the integrated terminal.

Expected result
	1. Sub-widget appears correctly.
	2. Labels are correct and complete.
	3. Magnetic Field Strength input via the slider is possible
	4. The limit values of the slider are correct
	5. Vector direction value input is possible
	6. Invalid input is restricted
	7. Description of the correct entry is shown if the field is empty
	8. No errors or warnings in the console.
