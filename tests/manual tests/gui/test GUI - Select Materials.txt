Manual test for the user story ‘GUI - Select Materials’

Test Goal: Check whether a sub-widget appears in the library widget that contains a selectable unit for the selection of materials with a corresponding label. Upon selection, the different parameters of the selected material should be displayed in the previously defined parameter screen.
User Story: As a student of material sciences, I'd like to easily select different materials for a given model, so that I can easily switch between and experiment with them, in order to get a better feel for their behaviour. I'd also like to see the properties of each material when I select them, so that I can see what I am working with.
