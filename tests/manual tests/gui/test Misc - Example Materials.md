# Manual Test for the User Story 'Misc - Example Materials'

### Test Goal
Check whether the sample meshes are visible in the GUI. 

### User Story
As an engineer, I’d like to quickly assess with which material I’d like to realize my magnetic soft robot designs. For that, material property research would slow me down, so I want to see a list of predefined materials, which I can choose from.

## Prerequisites
Make sure that the project is installed according to [README.md]() and [Requirements.txt]().

## Test


1. Switching between different materials 
    1. Select TPU Flexa Grey
        1. check density
    2. Check if there are materials from the website (https://www.matweb.com)


## Expected Result
1. density equals 700 kg/m³
2. There are around 30 materials from (https://www.matweb.com)
